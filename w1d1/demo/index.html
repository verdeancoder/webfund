                â€¢ request reponse lifecycle 
    - our brower has to make a request if we search up google.com
        that response is called a get request
                a post request says take data and do something
- somewhere out there a server gets the request and generates
                                                    a response
        if  it sends out a 200 response and that means success
            404 means error 
        500's is a internal server error
        these responses come back in the form of files -->
